# Simultanious-Equation-Solver

This script will solve any number of linear simultanious equations.
For those interested, it uses a matrix method for solving the equations.

## Useage :wrench:

Run the `main.py` script and enter the equations when prompted.
Once all equations are entered, press enter.

Constraints:
- Each term must be seperated by a space.
- Fractions are not supported: use decimal values instead.
- All equations must be linear.

Example:

    Enter equations: 
    > x + y + z = 3
    > 2x - y - z = -3
    > x + z + z - 1 + y = 8
    > 
    x = 0.0
    y = -3.0
    z = 6.0
